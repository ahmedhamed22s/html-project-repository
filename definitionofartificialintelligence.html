    <h2>definition of artificial intelligence </h2>
    It is the specific behavior and characteristics of computer programs that make them simulate human mental capabilities and working patterns. Among the most important of these characteristics is the ability to learn, infer, and react to situations not programmed in the machine. However, this term is controversial due to the lack of a specific definition of intelligence.

    And artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. Artificial intelligence is defined by many works as "the study and design of smart clients", and a smart customer is a system that absorbs its environment and takes situations that increase its chance of success in achieving its mission or the mission of its team.
