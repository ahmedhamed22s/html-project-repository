    <h2>problems of artificial intelligence </h2>
    The problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence is divided into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of specific features or capabilities that researchers would like embodied in an intelligent system. The features listed below received the most attention.
    <h2>Conclusion, logical thinking, and the ability to solve problems</h2>
    The first researchers in artificial intelligence developed algorithms that simulate the logical, logical reasoning that humans do when solving puzzles, playing table or logical conclusions. In the 1980s and 1990s, AI research led to very successful methods of dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, using concepts of probability and economics.

    For difficult problems, most of these algorithms require massive arithmetic resources - leading to a "fusion explosion": meaning that the amount of memory or time required for computers becomes an astronomer when the problem exceeds a certain size. The search for more problem solving algorithms is a top priority for AI research.

    Humans solve most of their problems by using quick, intuitive, and not conscious judgments, by a gradual deduction that enables the first researchers of artificial intelligence to simulate it automatically. Artificial Intelligence research has made some progress in imitating this "sub-symbolic" type of problem-solving skills: the approaches included in this emphasize the importance of kinesthetic skills for superior thinking; research in the field of neural networks tries to simulate the structures within the human and animal brain that give rise to this skill.
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    Machine science Machine learning has been central to AI research from the start. Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a large number of inputs. Supervised learning includes both classification (the ability to determine which category a thing belongs to, after seeing a number of models for several things from several categories), and regression (discovering a continuous mechanism that will generate outputs from the inputs, in light of a set of numerical inputs and outputs Examples). In orthodontic learning, a worker is rewarded for a good response and punished for a poor response. These responses can be analyzed in terms of decision theory, using concepts such as utility. Mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.

    <h2>perception</h2>
    Machine perception is the ability to use inputs from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sonar and other more exotic machines) to extract aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual inputs. A few sub-problems: speech recognition, facial recognition, and object recognition.
    <h2>General intelligence</h2>

    Most researchers hoped that their work would eventually merge into a machine with general intelligence '(known as strong artificial intelligence), combining all the aforementioned skills and exceeding most or all of human capabilities. Some believe that this project requires artificial human features such as artificial awareness or artificial brain.

    Many of the problems mentioned above are an integral part of the issue of complete artificial intelligence: to solve one problem, all of these problems must be solved. For example, a specific task like machine translation requires the machine to follow the writer's (mind) opinion, know what is being talked about (knowledge), and rewrite the intention of the writer faithfully (a social intelligence). Therefore, it is believed that machine translation is closely related to TI: strong AI may need to be translated as human.
